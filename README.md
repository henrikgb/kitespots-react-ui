## Personal training project - Kite Spots Jaeren

This project is all about testing new technologies and learning new stuff. 

My intention is to get training in setting up web applications from beginning to end. 

The plan is to:
- create a frontend-ui with React
- visualize coordinates on a map using Leaflet-React
- store coordinates as geoJson in MongoDB
- create API in C#, or similar technology
- connect all the dots and host the application with Azure
